# Project Epic Draft

Developers for .NET applications need a way to easily find where a specific error has occurred in their failed tests. We want to build an API that given a repository and error message, will return the occurrences of the error in the repository's failed test logs.

## Business Objectives
- [ ] P0: Developers can make a call to an API to search for all available Helix test logs that contain a specific error message to help with error investigation
- [ ] P1: Developers can refer to written documentation to understand how to make calls to the API.
- [ ] P2: Developers can interact with the API through a CLI/UI
